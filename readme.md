## 🚀 Features & Usage


1. ### Backtest Engine
    - Easy-to-use: Plug any `Strategy` subclass into `BacktestEngine()`

    - Computes daily positions, returns, and equity curve

    - Tracks buy-and-hold benchmark alongside strategy for comparison
  
---

2. ### Strategy Implementations
    - Mean Reversion: Z-score entry/exits for single assets

    - Momentum: Trend-following logic via moving averages

    - Pairs Trading: Spread-based strategy for hedged pairs (e.g., KO/PEP)
  
```bash
from strategies.mean_reversion import MeanReversionStrategy
strategy = MeanReversionStrategy(window=20, z_entry=1.5, z_exit=0.5)
```
---

3. ### Risk Management Modules
     **Apply these in sny backtest pipeline**
    
    - `apply_stop_loss(df, stop_loss_pct=0.02)`
    - `apply_position_sizing(df, risk_pct=0.02)`
    - `apply_drawdown_limit(df, max_drawdown=0.1)`

---
  
4. ### Execution Simulation
      **Simulates per-trade cost and slippage:**

```bash
exec_sim = ExecutionSimulator(slippage=0.0005, fee=0.0005)
df = exec_sim.adjust_returns(df)
```
---

5. ### Performance & Statistical Analysis
      **Use `StrategyAnalytics` to compute:**

    - Sharpe Ratio, Calmar Ratio, Max Drawdown
    - Annualized Return & Volatility
    - Significance testing via t-test and bootstrap resampling

```bash
analytics = StrategyAnalytics(df, return_col='net_strategy')
print(analytics.summary())
print("Significant?", analytics.is_significant())
```
---

6. ### Portfolio Optimization
      **Combine strategy returns across tickers, optimize via mean-variance, compare to equal-weight:**

```bash
from portfolio.optimizer import optimize_portfolio, equal_weight_portfolio
w_opt = optimize_portfolio(returns_df, risk_aversion=0.5)
w_eq = equal_weight_portfolio(returns_df)
```

## 📈 Visual Results & Analysis

### 1. Mean Reversion Strategy – AAPL
This plot compares the mean reversion strategy’s equity curve (blue) against a simple buy‑and‑hold benchmark (orange). 

![Mean Reversion: AAPL](images/mean_reversion_aapl.png) 

*Interpretation:* The strategy captures short-term reversals, shows periods of outperformance compared to hold, and illustrates drawdown behavior during trend shifts.

---

### 2. Execution‑Adjusted Equity – AAPL  
Here we apply slippage and execution cost adjustments to the strategy’s returns.

![Execution-Adjusted: AAPL](images/execution_adjusted.png) 

*Interpretation:* This more conservative equity curve highlights realistic P&L after trading friction, offering a true performance estimate.

---

### 3. Strategy Comparison – MSFT  
Side‑by‑side equity curves for mean‑reversion (blue) and momentum (orange) strategies on MSFT.

![Strategy Comparison: MSFT](images/strategy_comparison.png)

*Interpretation:* Shows how different strategy regimes (reversion vs trend) perform in different market environments.

---

### 4. Pairs Trading – KO vs PEP  
Out-of-sample backtest of a mean reversion strategy on the price spread between Coca‑Cola and Pepsi.

![Pairs Trading: KO vs PEP](images/pairs_trading.png) 

*Interpretation:* Indicates how pair‑based mean reversion can extract arbitrage profits from cointegrated stock pairs.

---

### 5. Portfolio Optimization – Optimized vs Equal Weighted  
Comparing a mean‑variance optimized portfolio against a simple equal‑weight allocation across AAPL, MSFT, and GOOGL.

![Portfolio Comparison](images/portfolio_comparison.png) 

*Interpretation:* Highlights the benefits of risk‑aware optimization in improving return per unit of risk.

---

### 6. Risk Management – Stop Loss & Position Sizing  
Applying fixed fractional position sizing and stop‑loss rules to the AAPL mean reversion strategy.  

![With Stop Loss + Position Sizing](images/risk_management.png)  

*Interpretation:* Demonstrates how capital preservation techniques reduce drawdowns and smooth equity growth.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

  - **Backtesting Engine:** Core event loop that feeds historical prices to strategies, records positions, returns, and equity curve.

  - **Strategy Pattern:** Each strategy (mean reversion, momentum, pairs) inherits from a common interface and defines its own signal logic.

  - **Risk Management:** Modular application of capital control rules before return calculation.

  - **Analytics:** Computation of all key metrics and tests to evaluate whether strategy performance is statistically valid.

  - **Portfolio Optimization:** Using mean and covariance of returns to compute optimal weights that maximize return-to-risk tradeoff.
